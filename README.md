# OOP Quiz Project:

This project is a mini-quiz built in Java by me and my friend using a graphical interface (`JFrame`) to test users' knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It includes multiple choice questions and a timer for each question.

## Features:

- **Timer**:  Each question must be answered within a set time limit (here 60 seconds).
- **Question Bank**: Multiple OOP-related questions are presented, with the ability to extend the list dynamically.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `CodeQuest.java` file.
3. Answer the multiple-choice questions.
4. View your results after completing the quiz or if time runs out.

Enjoy quizzing yourself on OOP concepts!
